A review of attempts to solve Pokemon (complete the game) with AI.
- Note: There are many variants of Pokemon games. We are referring to the type that requires exploration, catching Pokemon, battling (especially with Gym leaders to earn badges)
- Most of the works use Pokemon Red as the env


## Motivation
- Long horizon, requires complex planning
- Visual/Spatial reasoning which LLMs currently struggle at
- Requires commonsense, physical reasoning (e.g. needs to cut trees n push boulders) which LLMs struggle at times
- LLMs alone (or equipped with basic memory/tools) still fail to solve
- Easy for humans!
- RL based methods require a lot of reward crafting and resulted in reward hacking


## Strategies
